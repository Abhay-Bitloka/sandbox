	<h3>What is Git?</h3>
	<p>
		Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. 
		As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
		workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers 
		contributing to its initial development.
	</p>
	<h3>Branching</h3>
	<p>
		To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git stores its data. Git 
		doesn't store data as a series of changesets or deltas, but instead as a series of snapshots.A branch in Git is simply 
		a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make 
		commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
