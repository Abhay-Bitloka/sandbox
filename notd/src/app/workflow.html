	<h3>What is Git?</h3>
	<p>
		Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. 
		As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
		workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers 
		contributing to its initial development.
	</p>
	<h3>Branching</h3>
	<p>
		To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git stores its data. Git 
		doesn't store data as a series of changesets or deltas, but instead as a series of snapshots.A branch in Git is simply 
		a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make 
		commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.

		<h3>Git commands</h3>
		<p>Here are some steps you need to follow to access your Git repository. These steps shows you how to create your
			local branch and push the changes you made to your upstream. These commands have to be inserted in your Git Bash terminal</p><br>
		<ol>
			<li>git clone <url of your fork>- This step should be done only once ie when you begin for the first time</li>
			<li>git syncu </li> 
			<li>git branch </li>
			<li>git checkout -b "local branch name" </li>
			<li>git status </li>
			<li>git add --all </li>
			<li>git commit -m "message" </li>
			<li>git checkout master </li>
			<li>git syncu </li>
			<li>git checkout "branch name" </li>
			<li>git branch </li>
			<li>git merge master</li>
			<li>git push origin -u</li>
			<li>git checkout master</li>
			<li>Go to your Git account, pull request and merge it then go back to your terminal</li>
			<li>git branch -D "local branch name"</li>
			<li>git syncu</li>
			<li>git fetch --prune origin</li>
		</ol>
