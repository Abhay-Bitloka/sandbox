			<h4 style="color:initial"><em>Pre-school is the first experience for many children in a structured setting with teachers and group of children.</em></h4>
			<p>It’s an opportunity to learn, to share, to follow instructions and begin the foundation for learning. Every child has a unique way of learning and responding to the given learning environment. So activities are created around the preferred learning style that empowers the children to think and explore. Hence our school has adopted a unique concept of<br> <strong> “Play, Learn and Grow.”</strong></p>
