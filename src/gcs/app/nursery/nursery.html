			<p>Innovations are encouraged for effective relationship between teaching and learning, to help imbibe different perspectives within each subject area. Students become participants in learning, and their learning becomes linked to their life outside the school.</p>
            <p>Children settle down in the new environment, perfect their co-ordination, gradually improve their concentration and exhibit incredible creativity.</p>
			<p>Students are encouraged to actively participate in various activities.</p>
